# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

Tehcnigo Project to practice Objects and Arrays in Javascript, together with CSS and HTML.

## The problem

Started with creating the ojects and arrays, and connecting them to the DOM with the functions provided. Made sure everything worked, and then got on to the styling and making the page responsive. If I had more time, I would have done som styling to the decks before they were "clicked", to indikate what you should do with them and what would happen, and adding the "else-function" for reveal, promting the user to click the decks before trying to reveal.
